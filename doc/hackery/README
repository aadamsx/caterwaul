This directory contains various experiments that I use to make Caterwaul design
decisions. Most of it is performance-related.

You can create your own custom benchmarks. These are Waul files generated by
./experiment; usage is like this:

$ ./experiment name [optional notes about it]

You can then run the resulting file:

$ ./name
