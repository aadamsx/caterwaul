Dealing with Javascript suckage.
Javascript's builtin types are a mess. There isn't a reasonable hierarchy for things that are ordered (though < is magic enough to work properly most of the time), arrays aren't really
extensible, objects are a disaster, etc. Part of this is due to the crossover between the method table and the key-value pairing present on all references. But in any case, it would be really
nice to have a better interface for these things.

Tempting as it is to rebuild all of these types using real data structures, caterwaul isn't trying to solve that problem. So caterwaul internally and externally uses regular old Javascript
types whenever practical. (A notable exception is the global caterwaul function, which is an instance of itself under the caterwaul object system. But it produces and accepts standard
Javascript arrays and objects in general.)

It should be very easy to wrap standard data types however. So caterwaul provides a series of monads
