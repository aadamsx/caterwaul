These are the rendered versions of the files that make up Caterwaul's core.
You shouldn't use these directly since they may contain preprocessor directives.

These files are also generated. If you want to edit the originals, use the
caterwaul script in the main directory:

$ ./caterwaul ls -a js::core/
sdoc::js::core/caterwaul
sdoc::js::core/caterwaul.introduction
# ...
$ ./caterwaul edit sdoc::js::core/caterwaul
# hack away
$ ./caterwaul render
