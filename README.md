# Caterwaul

Caterwaul is a programming language that compiles into Javascript. The syntax is a superset of Javascript, so you can easily use it from inside existing JS code. Caterwaul also includes a
number of design choices that make it an ideal foundation for a Javascript or Caterwaul IDE.

Version 1.4 is still under construction.
