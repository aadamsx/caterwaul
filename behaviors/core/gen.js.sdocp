Previous to caterwaul 1.0 they were encoded as standard-library macros, which created a lot of module interdependence and\nmacroexpansion overhead (especially since most of them weren\'t used frequently in regular code). Now they\'re regular methods that take syntax trees as arguments.\n\nScope creation.\nCreating a scope is one of the most common patterns. These methods create various kinds of scopes.\n\n  caterwaul.namespace(\'scope\')');
