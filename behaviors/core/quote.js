// Introduction.
// Quotation is very important for defining macros. It enables the qs[] form in your code, which returns a piece of quoted syntax. qs is an adjective, and its exact rendition depends on which
// language port you're using. For the native JS port, it will be enabled in these forms:

// | qs[x]
//   x /qs

  caterwaul.configuration('core.quote', function () {this.unary_adjective('qs', function (tree) {return tree})});
// Generated by SDoc
