sdocp('sdoc::js::behaviors/core/quote', 'Quotation behavior | Spencer Tipping\nLicensed under the terms of the MIT source code license\n\nIntroduction.\nQuotation is very important for defining macros. It enables the qs[] form in your code, which returns a piece of quoted syntax. qs is an adjective, and its exact rendition depends on which\nlanguage port you\'re using. For the native JS port, it will be enabled in these forms:\n\n| qs[x]\n  x /qs\n\n  caterwaul.unary_adjective(\'qs\', function (tree) {return tree});');
