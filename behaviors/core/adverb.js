// Introduction.
// Many macros in caterwaul function as adverbs from a linguistic point of view. Adverbs in English modify a process, but generally the process is more relevant than the adverb so we talk about
// it first. (Hence sentences such as 'go there if you need to' -- here 'if you need to' is the adverb, and it comes after the rest.)

  caterwaul.macro_form('prefix_adverb',  function (name, def, form) {this.rmacro(form.replace({_adverb: name}, def))}).
            macro_form('postfix_adverb', function (name, def, form) {this.rmacro(form.replace({_adverb: name}, def))});
