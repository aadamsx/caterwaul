Caterwaul JS: a Javascript to Javascript compiler
Visit http://caterwauljs.org for documentation.

Stable builds of caterwaul are in the stable/ directory. Builds ending with 'rN',
such as '0.3.4r1', are revisions that fix some bug but don't change functionality.

Builds ending with 'bN' are beta and should NOT be used if correctness matters!
(Though if you see one that's been around for a while, it's probably ok.) These
builds are primarily for me to test against and probably have bugs. That said,
if you do happen to use one and find a problem, e-mail me and I'll fix it before
releasing a non-beta.

There's a Vim syntax highlighter in build/. You can use it by copying it to your
~/.vim/syntax, then adding this to your .vimrc:

au BufReadPost,BufNewFile *.js   set syntax=caterwaul
au BufReadPost,BufNewFile *.waul set syntax=caterwaul

For automatic Waul file detection, follow the instructions in
build/caterwaul-filetype.vim.
