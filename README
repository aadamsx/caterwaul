Caterwaul JS: a Javascript to Javascript compiler
Visit http://caterwauljs.org for documentation.

Stable builds of caterwaul are in the stable/ directory. Builds ending with 'rN',
such as '0.3.4r1', are revisions that fix some bug but don't change functionality.

Builds ending with 'bN' are beta and should NOT be used if correctness matters!
These builds are primarily for me to test against and probably have bugs. That
said, if you do happen to use one and find a problem, e-mail me and I'll fix it
before releasing a non-beta.
