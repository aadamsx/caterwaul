Caterwaul shell
This is a REPL that macroexpands code you type into it. Below the prompt is a
macroexpansion preview. The default shell page has external dependencies, but
combined.html is self-contained (modulo jQuery and Caterwaul, which are loaded
over HTTP) and can be served from anywhere to have a powerful API testing
interface.
