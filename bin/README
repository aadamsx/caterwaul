Statically-linked copies of the Waul precompiler. This allows you to maintain
offline-precompiled Caterwaul scripts that use different versions of Caterwaul
and link them together after each is compiled.

In order to take advantage of this, I recommend that you chmod +x your Waul
source files, adding a shebang line to the top of each one to compile it:

#!/usr/bin/env waul-1.2b5

This takes Waul version selection out of the picture, so build scripts can
simply execute each Waul script to compile it.
