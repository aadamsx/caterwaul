sdocp('modules/caterwaul.overload.js.sdoc', 'Operator/syntax overloading module | Spencer Tipping\nLicensed under the terms of the MIT source code license\n\nIntroduction.\nOperator overloading in JS is generally slow and error-prone (if you transform your whole program), but sometimes it\'s really useful. Operators that don\'t exist for some object end up falling\nback to the default Javascript operator behavior. This is also true when the object in question is null or undefined.\n\nYou can use this module for a localized region of code by doing this:\n\n| locally.overload[...]\n\n  caterwaul.tconfiguration(\'std seq\', \'overload\', function () {\n    this.rmacro(qs[overload[_]], \n    });\n');
