Caterwaul Modules
=================

These are modules in development for Caterwaul. Once they're finished (i.e. ready for production use or beta testing), each will have a corresponding minified file, e.g.
``caterwaul.recon.min.js``.

You probably won't use modules straight from here, since commonly-used modules are put into ``caterwaul.all.js`` and ``caterwaul.all.min.js`` in the main directory.
