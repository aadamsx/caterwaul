These macros abstract that away and let you handle errors in various ways. The simplest macro is\nprobably error.quietly[], which silently ignores any errors. (It just returns false instead of whatever the expression would have returned.) Slightly more complex is error.safely[][], which\ntakes two forms. The first is evaluated, and the result returned if there are no errors. If there is an error, then the second is evaluated in a context where \'error\' is bound to the error\nobject, and that result is returned.\n\nAlso provided is an expression-mode throw, which lets you throw errors without returning to statement syntax. This is written error.fail[x], where x is the expression to be thrown. (JavaScript\ndoesn\'t let you use the word \'throw\', so an alternative word was needed.)\n\ncaterwaul.tconfiguration(\'std\', \'error\', function () {\n  this.rmacro(qs[error.safely[_][_]], fn[expression, handler][qs[qg[function () {try {return _} catch (error) {return _}}].call(this)].s(\'_\', [expression, handler])]).\n       rmacro(qs[error.quietly[_]],   fn[expression]         [qs[qg[function () {try {return _} catch (error) {return false}}].call(this)].s(\'_\', expression)]).\n       rmacro(qs[error.fail[_]],      fn[expression]         [qs[qg[function () {throw _}].call(this)].s(\'_\', expression)])});\n');
