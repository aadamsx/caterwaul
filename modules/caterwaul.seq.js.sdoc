Introduction.
Javascript's looping facilities are side-effectful and more importantly operate in statement-mode rather than expression-mode. This sequence library moves finite and anamorphic looping into
expression-mode using both methods and macros. Macros are used sparingly here; they provide comprehensions, but are ultimately just shorthands for sequence methods.
