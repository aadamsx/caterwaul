Source files for Caterwaul. These are maintained in self-modifying Perl files,
just like in previous versions. However, they've been split out:

./caterwaul  contains the core Caterwaul build; this is the parser, compiler,
             and stuff related to the global caterwaul object

./std        contains the standard library and generates build/caterwaul.std.js
./ui         contains the jQuery library and generates build/caterwaul.ui.js

Version 1.2 and forward use a bootstrapping setup involving offline
compilation. The 'waul' files correspond to attributes in the self-modifying
Perl files and are individually compiled into Javascript files in build/. Then
the rendered Javascript files are combined into a compiled file such as
caterwaul.std.js. Finally, that file is minified.

Offline compilation is done with the 'waul' compiler in the previous directory.
This compiler is rebuilt from ../caterwaul using build/caterwaul.min.js,
build/caterwaul.std.min.js, and build/caterwaul.ui.min.js.
